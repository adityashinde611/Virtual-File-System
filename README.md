# Virtual-File-System

This project is used to emulate all functionalities provided by File systems.

#### Platform required
Windows NT platform OR Linux Distributions

#### Architectural requirement
Intel 32 bit processor

#### User Interface
Command User Interface

#### Technology used
C programming

### Description
- - - -
* In this project we emulate all data structures which are used by operating system to
manage File system oriented tasks.
* As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in Primary storage.
* In this project we create all data structures which required for File Subsystems as
Inode Inode Table, File Table,User File Descriptor Table, Super block etc.
* We provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File
subsystem as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.
* While providing the implementations of all above functionality we use our own data
structures by referring Algorithms of UNIX operating system.
* By using this project we can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.
